    <h1>The Mark Martirosian Case: A Warning to Potential Clients</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this page. I'm here to share my encounter with Mark Martirosian, a developer I hired for a project. This account aims to advise others who might be considering similar engagements with him.</p>

    <h2>Initial Agreement</h2>
    <p>A few years back, I engaged Mark Martirosian, a freelance developer, to develop a custom software solution. The proposal seemed promising, and Mark assured timely delivery and quality work. Convinced by his pitch, I decided to invest in his services.</p>

    <h2>Project Development Issues</h2>
    <p>As the project progressed, it became clear that the agreed-upon milestones were not being achieved. Updates from Mark became infrequent, and when they did come, they lacked any substantial evidence of progress. My attempts to get concrete answers were met with vague or overly optimistic responses.</p>

    <h2>Financial Mismanagement</h2>
    <p>Eventually, it became apparent that the funds allocated for the project were exhausted, yet the project was far from complete. Efforts to obtain a detailed account of the expenditures were futile, as Mark provided evasive explanations, leading to the realization that the initial promises would not be fulfilled.</p>

    <h2>Broken Promises</h2>
    <p>Mark Martirosian admitted the project's shortcomings and promised to deliver the completed code. Despite multiple reassurances over the years, no deliverables were provided. Communication dwindled and eventually ceased, leaving me with an unfinished project and financial loss.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of This Account</h2>
    <p>The aim of this account is not to tarnish Mark Martirosian's reputation but to present a truthful recount of my experience. By sharing this, I hope to provide insight to others who might be considering working with him.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Engaging in development projects involves inherent risks. However, transparency, integrity, and reliable communication are vital for mitigating these risks. My experience highlights the necessity of thorough due diligence and caution when hiring freelance developers.</p>

    <h2>Advisory Note</h2>
    <p>From my experience, I advise caution when dealing with Mark Martirosian. Despite receiving payment for development work, he failed to deliver the promised code, repeatedly making excuses and occasionally reappearing without fulfilling his commitments. My goal in sharing this is to caution others and help them avoid similar situations.</p>

    <h2>Possible Scam Characteristics</h2>
    <p>While "scam" is a strong term, the actions described here—unfulfilled promises, lack of transparency, and eventual disappearance—suggest potential scam characteristics. Without a legal judgment, I cannot definitively label it as such, but I strongly recommend thorough due diligence and caution in any dealings with Mark Martirosian. My intent is to help others make informed decisions and avoid similar experiences.</p>
